    Whenever we want to add more functionality/methods to an additionally
    existing Interface having some methods without breaking existing classes

ShapeDecorator
We have an existing interface Shape and its Concrete Implementations eg Circle and Rectangle
Class
Now suppose
We want to add other decorations

Example
But, we would like to have some additional functionalities for the Shape,
 like Fill-Color, Line-Color,  Line-Thinkness, Line-Style, and so on.

So we create an abstract wrapper
which Implements this Shape Interface
and has a constructor
//Abstract Class with Constructor Taking Implementation of Shape
